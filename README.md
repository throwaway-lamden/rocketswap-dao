# rocketswap-dao
**Do not deploy the SC \*as-is\*.** There are certain changes made for greater convenience that are insecure. Those changes are clearly marked in the contract, and should take no longer then 5 minutes to implement. 

The Rocketswap DAO project tries to implement something similar to Aragon, but for the Lamden Blockchain ecosystem. 

At this time, there is no frontend.
